Passionate and highly motivated,  engineer and developer of software and software technology products who creates technology that helps people in their daily lives, professionals in their work, and businesses in reaching their goals and intended impacts.

I have Bachelors in Computer Science focused toward software development where I have gained the knowledge, skills, and experience to efficiently engineer and develop software by learning and applying them in software engineering projects under the education, guidance, and instruction of highly educated and experienced industry experts.

I also have an illustrious (12) year career in the United States Marine Corps which gives me the proven experience to adapt to multiple and emerging technologies, efficiently resolve complex problems based on situationally evolving priorities, successfully conducting change management and technology upgrades, and team successes by contributing to and leading cross discipline teams collaboratively from varying and diverse backgrounds.

Marine Corps education for my technical positions and work experience provides me a unique perspective and depth of skill in design, integration, fault isolation, and creating solutions in delivering technology services, and products that do add to and compliment my ability to develop software.

As an instructor of multiple areas in the Marine Corps, I have developed a proven meticulous attention to detail, an understanding of systems at a high level, and an understanding of techniques in detail. I have improved the efficiency of 450+ team members in progressing their technical skills through continuously delivered knowledge, experience, evaluation, alongside customized micro adjustments and delivery of instruction which does translate into an ability to continuously learn, teach, and communicate information effectively across a team.

I have a Bachelors in Computer Science focused toward software development where I have gained the knowledge, skills, and experience to efficiently engineer and develop software by learning and applying taught ability practically in software engineering projects under the education, guidance, and instruction of highly educated and experienced industry experts.

before completing education I was in the United States Marine Corps for about 12 years providing me a unique perspective of tools compared to traditionally educated developers in how I approach and conduct design, integration, networking, fault isolation, and creating solutions in delivering technology services and products. Experience in the military gives me the experience of adapting to multiple and emerging technologies, efficiently resolving complex problems based on situationally evolving priorities, successfully conducting change management, maintanance, and security in both sysytem integrations and technology upgrades, and team successes by contributing to and leading cross discipline teams collaboratively from varying and diverse backgrounds. Much of the skills developed in my technical education and working experience compliments and adds to my ability as an engineer

As a Computer Science graduate and software engineer, I build impactful technology solutions for individuals and businesses. My 12 years of service in the US Marine Corps, specializing in telecommunications, electronic systems, and communication systems provides me with a unique perspective on design, integration, and troubleshooting. This experience, coupled with my formal education, allows me to approach complex problems with a systems-level understanding, focusing on signal flow, configuration, and component-level analysis to deliver robust and efficient technology.
